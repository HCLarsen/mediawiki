By weight, it is 6.67% carbon and 93.3% iron. It has an [[orthorhombic]] crystal structure.<ref name=\"smith363\">{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=363}}</ref> It is a hard, brittle material,<ref name=\"smith363\"/> normally classified as a [[ceramic]] in its pure form, and is a frequently found and important constituent in [[ferrous metallurgy]]. While cementite is present in most steels and cast irons,<ref name=\"Durand\">{{harvnb|Durand-Charre|2003}}</ref> it is produced as a raw material in the iron carbide process, which belongs to the family of alternative ironmaking technologies. The name ''cementite'' originated from the research of [[Floris Osmond]] and J. Werth, where the structure of solidified steel consists of a kind of cellular tissue in theory, with [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] as the nucleus and Fe<sub>3</sub>C the envelope of the cells. The carbide therefore ''cemented'' the iron.<ref>{{cite journal |author=H. K. D. H.

In carbon [[steel]], cementite precipitates from [[austenite]] as austenite transforms to ferrite on slow cooling, or from [[martensite]] during [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]. An intimate mixture with ferrite, the other product of austenite, forms a [[lamellar structure]] called [[pearlite]].\n\nWhile cementite is thermodynamically unstable, eventually being converted to austenite (low carbon level) and graphite (high carbon level) at higher temperatures, it does not decompose on heating at temperatures below the [[Eutectic system#Eutectoid|eutectoid]] temperature (723&nbsp;°C) on the metastable iron-carbon phase diagram.\n\n==Pure form==\nCementite changes from [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] to [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] at its [[Curie temperature]] of approximately 480 K.<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://zenodo.org/record/1431493 |author=S.W.J.
